## Content Tone & Voice

### Overall Tone
- **Optimistic but grounded**: Solarpunk utopia is possible, but we're building step-by-step
- **Technical but accessible**: Deep technical details available, but understandable to non-engineers
- **Open and transparent**: Show the work, admit challenges, invite collaboration
- **Vision-driven**: Long-term thinking, multi-decade project, systemic change

### Writing Style
- **Active voice**: "AI agents scan research papers" not "Research papers are scanned"
- **Concrete examples**: Show real data, real iterations, real cost savings
- **Avoid hype**: No "revolutionary" or "game-changing" without evidence
- **Embrace complexity**: Don't oversimplify, but explain clearly

### Content Principles
1. **Show, don't just tell**: Visualizations, metrics, actual results
2. **Technical depth on demand**: Summary visible, details expandable
3. **Multiple entry points**: For developers, makers, researchers, general audience
4. **Authentic story**: Solo scientist-founder building in public

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for body text
- Minimum contrast ratio 3:1 for large text and graphics
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Skip navigation links available

### Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Landmark regions (header, nav, main, aside, footer)
- Alt text for all images and visualizations
- ARIA labels for interactive elements

### Motion & Animation
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Disable complex animations for users requesting reduced motion
- Ensure core content accessible without JavaScript

### Screen Reader Optimization
- Descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Table headers for data tables
- Form labels associated with inputs
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content
